# PyBer Analysis of Ride Statistics for 2019

Continuing analysis of ride statistics aids in optimizing business process and profit.   Analytics are also an aid to increase funding opportunities and funds raised by focusing on the health of the business and its operations.   

## The Analysis
This analysis produced a summary of the total revenue and average fare by city type as well as the average fare per driver.  In addition, an in depth comparison of total weekly fares was charted for the first 4 months of 2019 between the 3 city types PyBer operates in; Urban, Suburban and Rural.

## Results:

### Overview
There were 2,375 rides that generated $63,537 over the time period studied.  That data is broken down in the following chart:

It is clearly shown in the ride summary table that the company’s business is driven (pun intended) by its Urban business.   The Urban locations produce the highest number of rides and fares.    However, it also has the highest number of drivers.   This drives down the average fare per driver over the 2 location types measured.   This is not such great news for the driver population operating in the Urban locations.


#### Focused Time Period
When the ride data was charted over the first 4 months of 2019 there were some very clear trends identified.

-	Ride volume stays the same for much of that time.    While there is some spiking in certain times of the month, ridership varies within 500 rides (more or less) in any given week all month long in each of the 3 city types.   The fact that the Rural city type never has more than 500 rides per week in any given month should also be noted when in relation to the other 2 city types.


## Recommendations
-	It is clear that while Pyber makes the most revenue from Urban rides in total, Rural rides are the highest revenue on a per ride basis.   More should be done to understand why this is so.   Pyber should collect the following data for all rides; mileage, start and stop time

-	As stated, Average Fare per ride is best for Rural rides however, rural rides make up only about 5% of total rides and about 7% of total revenue.   The money is in Urban rides and that is where the focus of the company should remain unless major changes in the economic climate occur.

-	Urban drivers make up the largest segment of drivers in the PyBer stable.   It would be interesting to see what the dates of hire of these drivers are and how long they stay with the company.   While this data does not address driver retention, it can play an important role is increasing revenue on a mile/fare basis, which is a much truer measure of profitability in this transportation sector.    Per Ride profitability will increase Driver longevity and is a measure of Driver knowledge – as Drivers become more knowledgeable of the location in which they drive, they will find ways to reduce cost and drive up profits -  shortcuts, operating times, and car type all impact these measures.   It would be fruitful to add these measures to the next data collection window to increase knowledge of Driver longevity and overall profitability.
